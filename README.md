# Microbial Biodiversity Dashboard

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

For this assignment, we were tasked with building an interactive dashboard to explore Professor Robert Dunn's (North Carolina State University) [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.
